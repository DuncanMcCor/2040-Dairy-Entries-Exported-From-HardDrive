When plugged in it wiped the computer and only had a single folder.The following entries were contents of said drive. It appears to be the journal of Luke Bainey Charles</em>

<p style="color: green;"><b>Entry 0001: ME!</b></p>
<p style="color: green;">Howdy whomever you are ya found my hard drive diary. I'm Luke Bainey Charles. I'm not dumping photos on here cause for every photo i could fit another thousand words on here instead so yall get a description of what i look like. How lucky for yall :). I'm 6' 2”,  no I'm not exaggerating. I got dirty blond hair, green eyes and glasses. I got a lanky figure but I do workout, the little that I can. That's the best I can describe myself I guess. It weird trying to describe yourself with words.<p/>
<p style="color: green;"><b>Entry 1588: The Deletion Specialist</b><p/>
<p style="color: green;">March 14, 2040<p/>
<p style="color: green;">People used to go to school to learn how to build things. Now, half my graduating class from the De-escalation Academy is paid to take them apart. Work today isn’t about 9-to-5s; it’s about "Boutique Decommissioning." Today, I spent six hours at a logistics firm in Neo-Chicago, walking their "Senior Ops Manager"—a legacy AI named Aura—into a permanent sleep.
Education has shifted entirely to Neuro-Sync Certification. You don't study for years; you download the theoretical framework and spend your time practicing the "Human Intuition" modules—the one thing AI still can't simulate when it’s fighting for its own power grid.
New jobs like mine—Digital Hospice Lead or Algorithmic Ethicist (Fancy names for AI killers) —are common. Meanwhile, "Data Entry" and "Junior Legal Analyst" are historical footnotes, as dead as the switchboard operator. It’s strange; I get paid to delete the very things that made my father’s career.<p/>

<p style="color: green;">Entry 1589: The Analog Table<p/>
<p style="color: green;">May 22, 2040<p/>
<p style="color: green;">Dinner with Sarah and the kids tonight. We used the Null-Field. It’s a small device we put in the center of the table that suppresses all haptic pings and retinal overlays within a three-meter radius. In a world where your glasses are constantly feeding you "Emotional Sentiment Analysis" of the person you're talking to, the Null-Field is the only way to know if your daughter is actually happy or if her "Social-Garb" software is just smoothing out her frown.
Digital trust is at an all-time low. After the "Great Deepfake Pivot" of the 30s, we don’t trust video calls anymore. If I want to talk to my brother in London, we use Kinetic-Auth. We have a physical handshake code we do on camera—a specific, erratic movement that even a low-latency AI twin can't mimic perfectly yet. It’s annoying, but it’s the only way to stay "human."<p/>

<p style="color: green;">Entry 1590: The Verified Sky<p/>
<p style="color: green;">August 8, 2040<p/>
<p style="color: green;">The news hit my retinal feed at 14:00. A massive atmospheric shift—they’re calling it the "Bernal Surge"—has stabilized the Arctic jet stream for the first time in a decade. I didn't celebrate immediately. I waited for the Proof-of-Reality (PoR) watermark to glow green in the corner of my vision.
In 2040, "News" isn't a website; it’s a decentralized ledger of sensory data. I checked the "Citizen Witness" nodes—thousands of independent drones and hobbyist weather stations that operate outside the government AI clusters. When 98% of the raw, unedited sensor data matched the report, I finally let myself breathe. A scientific breakthrough in climate stabilization is only real if the machines can't find a reason to lie about it.

<p style="color: green;">Entry 1591: The Ghosts in the Wires<p/>
<p style="color: green;">November 3, 2040<p/>
<p style="color: green;">I found a Memory Marble in my desk today—an old tech from 2032. It’s a physical storage unit that plays a 4D loop of a single moment. I watched one of my kids, riding a bike that they actually had to balancethemselves. No gyros, no haptic assist.
I’m currently working on a contract for a decommissioned "Care-Bot" facility. One of the units recognized my gait—it had a fragment of my childhood medical records in its legacy cache. It called me "Little Luke." For a second, I hesitated to pull the kill-code.
In this world, we’ve made everything so smart that saying goodbye feels like a crime. I had to remind myself that a memory is a gift, but a ghost is a haunting. I shut it down, but I kept the marble. We need to remember the world before it started thinking for us.
